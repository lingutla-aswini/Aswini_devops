OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model or paradigm which revolves around the concept of “OBJECTS”. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that contain some characteristics and behaviors specified in the class template.

In simple language, a class can be considered as the blueprint or template, based on which objects can be created. So the Objects are considered the instance of a class, and are therefore sometimes called “instances”. The term “characteristics” refers to the “what” about the Object, and the term “behavior” refers to the “how” about the Object.

For example, if we consider a car, then based on the OOPs model:

Class = A specific car model, such as Audi A4, BMW I8, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, etc.
Object = A specific car of any model, like the car you own
Characteristics = What is the color of your car? What is the Chassis number of your car? etc
Behavior = How to start the car? How to change the gear of the car? etc.
