Characteristics are also known as data, attributes, or properties, and Behaviours are also known as the functions, procedures or methods, in the programming language.

The concept of “objects” allows the OOPs model to easily access, use and modify the instance data and methods, interact with other objects, and define methods in runtime (during the execution of the program). This gives the OOPs model significance and makes it diverse in its implementation.

In fact, the OOPs model is so popular, that many of the most widely used programming languages support and use this Object Oriented Programming or OOPs model, such as Java, C++, Python, C#, etc.
